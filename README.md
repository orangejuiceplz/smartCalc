# smartCalc

Just a little calculator that I'm developing in C++. 

Command Line Interface at the moment.

## My current plan for this project

I want this to be a calculator that I can always refer to if I'm in ever need of specific calculations/time saving stuff.

## So, whats the deal? Why write it in C++ instead of like py?

Simple, I'm trying to learn C++. This works as a great exercise for me!

## Developer Roadmap:

| Day | Progress |
| --- | -------- |
|  1  | I decided on the idea of building a smart calculator (a calculator with lots of inbuilt functions) in C++. I have initialized a GitHub repo with all of the files and will start building   the.cpp file. I have all of the necessary libraries on my main computer and will use vscode as my IDE of choice. Features should include but not be limited to: basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, simplifying radicals, (hopefully adding currency APIs), statistical functions, complex numbers, surface area/arc length, formula 'cheat sheet', prime factorization (number theory). |

## Execution

C++

```
// simple really; just a simple call function to the class

... 
int main() {
SmartCalculator calc;
    calc.run();
}
```
