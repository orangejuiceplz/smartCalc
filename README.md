<h1 align="center">ðŸ§® smartCalc: a nice introduction to new C++ concepts and a refresher on old</h1>


Hey! Welcome to **smartCalc**, a personal project (not really) born out of a desire to master C++ concepts (somewhat true). It's more than just a calculatorâ€”it's a smart calculator where I experiment with various math concepts and functionalities, all accessible through a ~~ugly~~ pretty command-line interface (CLI). 


## Why smartCalc?

### The motivation behind the code

~~I was forced to for a comp sci project.~~ I started on this to create a multipurpose tool that could handle everything from basic calculations to complex mathematical operations. Whether it's calculating the surface area of a sphere or finding the roots of a quadratic equation, smartCalc aims to be my Ti-84 PLUS CE when it's not in reach.

### Choosing C++ Over Python

## So, whats the deal? Why write it in C++ instead of like py?

While py might seem like the obvious choice for such a project due to its simplicity and extensive library support, I chose C++ for a very specific reason **learning** the syntax and functions because its hell to pick up later.  This project serves as a practical platform to dive deeper into my understanding of C++, exploring its capabilities in a real world situations.

## Developer Roadmap:

| Day | Progress |
| --- | -------- |
|  1  | I decided on the idea of building a smart calculator (a calculator with lots of inbuilt functions) in C++. I have initialized a GitHub repo with all of the files and will start building   the.cpp file. I have all of the necessary libraries on my main computer and will use vscode as my IDE of choice. Features should include but not be limited to: basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, simplifying radicals, (hopefully adding currency APIs), statistical functions, complex numbers, surface area/arc length, formula 'cheat sheet', prime factorization (number theory). |

|  4  |          |
|  5  |          |
|  6  |          |
|  7  |          |
|  8  |          |
|  9  |          |
| 10  |          |
| 11  |          |

## Getting setup with the calculator:

To run smartCalc, simply clone the repository and compile the `SmartCalculator.cpp` file using your C++ compiler of choice. Here's a quick example of how to execute the program:

```
cpp #include "SmartCalculator.h"

int main() {
SmartCalculator calc;
    calc.run();
}
```

## Sidenotes

> ## Reflections on the project initally.

Working on smartCalc for the short amount of time so far has been an incredibly ~~painful~~ amazing experience. From dealing with the complexities of C++ to integrating APIs for the first time, every challenge that I will encounter along the way has contributed to a deeper understanding of software development
