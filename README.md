> As the year closes out, I've decided to pick back up this project. I look to overhaul literally everything, and probably making a different repo is better for this, but who honestly cares. I sure as hell don't.
> The plan is to:
> convert from WxWidgets to Qt5/6, still undecided for the UI and overhaul some of the methods. I may turn this into a lib or something too for easier use, but still I don't know.
> I want other functionalities as well, maybe even AI or Discord integration.
> smartCalc v2 will probably fully release sometime in early-mid 2025 (At most late Q2)
> Although nobody is reading this, I'm guessing.
